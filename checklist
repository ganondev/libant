Grid:
	3D in general
	Adding cells to scan list
	Dictionary of cells -- to quadtree eventually?
		For now, check out https://github.com/mystborn/GenericMap
	Count of uniquely visited cells
	Count of total moves so far

Ant
	Ant2DCartesian -- Limit position tuple size to 2
		LangtonsAnt -- Comes with a default directive
	Rework position setter to be more OO friendly

Alg:
	Highway Detection

Going with enumerated orientation for now.
